Hi Digital Marketplace Buyer,  
  
We are writing to let you know that sellers are requesting feedback for {{ brief_name }} on the Marketplace. To assist with communications, we request that buyers contact all sellers who have responded, to update them on the progress of the opportunity.
  
We recommend that you do this:

- after you shortlist sellers, and 
- after awarding the opportunity to a seller
  
If you need help with this, please email us at [marketplace@digital.gov.au](mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au).  
  
  
Thanks,  
  
The Digital Marketplace team
