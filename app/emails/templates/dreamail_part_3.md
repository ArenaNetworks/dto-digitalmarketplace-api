Dear {{supplier_name}},

The Digital Marketplace has taken the initiative to assess your company for the categories in which case studies had been submitted but assessment has not yet been requested. This was done in an effort to help you increase your access to opportunities through the Marketplace. We have found that the following categories would not yet pass assessment with the information currently provided:

No action is needed at the moment, but should you wish to sell your services through the Digital Marketplace in these categories at a later date, youâ€™ll need to strengthen your case studies. This means ensuring that they meet the [assessment criteria](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/333757011655-Assessment-criteria). If you need help, please also see our support article, [writing a case study](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115011407668-Adding-case-studies).

If you are no longer interested in selling in that category, please consider removing it from your profile, so that buyers can focus on your core business when reviewing your profile.
