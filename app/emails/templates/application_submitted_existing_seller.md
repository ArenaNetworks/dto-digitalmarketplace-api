Hi {{contact_name}},

Thanks for updating your profile and accepting the new Master Agreement.

Your new content will go live when we form the Digital Marketplace Panel in a few weeks. Our approach to market was published on AusTender on 23/02/2017 and a minimum of 25 days must pass before a new panel can be formed.

Weâ€™ll send you an email to let you know when the changes are live.

**You can still apply for opportunities while you wait for the changes to appear.** 

We also recommend reading our [seller guide]({{url_sellers_guide}}).

It explains:

1. Why you need to express interest in opportunities early
2. The assessment process
3. How to offer new products or services

Thanks for your ongoing participation in the Marketplace.

The Marketplace team

**Your feedback shapes the Marketplace**

The Digital Marketplace is an agile development in Beta. This means it will evolve over time in response to user needs. If you have any questions, feedback or would like to help shape the service by being involved in user research, email [marketplace@digital.gov.au](mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au).
