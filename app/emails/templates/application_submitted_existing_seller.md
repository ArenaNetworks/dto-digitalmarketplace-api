Hi {{contact_name}},

Thanks for updating your profile and accepting the new Master Agreement.

The changes are now being reviewed before being published on the seller catalogue. Weâ€™ll send you an email to let you know when the changes are live.

If you've added new services we recommend reading our [seller guide](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/categories/115001540368-Seller-guide-and-FAQs). It explains the assessment process for each new service and why you need to express interest as early as possible.

Thanks for being part of the Digital Marketplace.

The Digital Marketplace team
