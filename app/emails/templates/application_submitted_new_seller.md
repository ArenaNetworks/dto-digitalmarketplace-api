Hi {{contact_name}},

Good news. You're almost ready to start responding to opportunities on the Marketplace. We’ve received your application but before you can go ahead, there's a two step process of **registration** and **approval** we'd like you to be aware of.

### Step one — becoming a registered seller

We’ll now review your application. If accepted, we’ll list you as a registered seller. This takes around 10 business days. Registered sellers will appear in our seller catalogue. We'll also email you about new opportunities. However, you'll still need to be approved before you can respond to opportunities.

### Step two — becoming an approved seller
There is no cost to becoming an approved seller. This is the process of assessing your capability to offer services, based on the area of expertise listed in the opportunity. The focus of our assessment is on **case studies, commercial capability and pricing**. If your assessment is successful, you can then start responding to opportunities. If you’re unsuccessful, we’ll let you know and provide some feedback about what you need to do to resubmit.


**What if you see an opportunity but are not yet an approved seller?**  
Our aim is to help you respond to opportunities as soon as possible. If you see an opportunity you'd like to respond to before you’re approved, you can ‘[request an assessment](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115011292847-Request-an-assessment)’ and ask to be prioritised. You’ll find this option at the bottom of the opportunity itself.
 
We also recommend reading our [seller guide](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/categories/115001540368-Seller-guide-and-FAQs). This will answer most of your questions.
If your application needs any corrections, we’ll be in touch to clarify.


**Questions or concerns**  
If you need further information or have any queries, please email us at [marketplace@digital.gov.au](mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au)

Looking forward to seeing you on the Marketplace soon.
