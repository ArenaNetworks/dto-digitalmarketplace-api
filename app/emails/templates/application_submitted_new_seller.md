Hi,

We received your application to join the Digital Marketplace.

We'll now review your application and this should take around 10 business days. Once accepted, we'll list you as a registered seller.

Registered sellers will appear in our seller catalogue, visible to all buyers on the Marketplace. We recommend reading our [seller guide]({{url_sellers_guide}}) to answer most of your questions.

If your application needs any corrections, we'll be in touch to clarify.

For any queries please email us at [marketplace@digital.gov.au](mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au).

Looking forward to seeing you on the Marketplace soon!

Regards,  
The Digital Marketplace team
