Dear {{supplier_name}},

We recently completed a [value for money](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000054595-Seller-pricing) (VFM) assessment on the Marketplace. As part of this process, we requested that you submit your maximum day rate for the categories listed further below.
  

#### What has happened?
When compared to pricing submitted by other sellers offering similar services in the same categories, we’ve noticed that your prices are above the suggested maximum daily threshold. In some areas, case study material may also need to be strengthened.
  

#### What you can do
Please consider revising your pricing and/or **case study material**. Stronger case study material that demonstrates your capabilities, may provide justification as to why your price is higher when compared to other sellers.

Alternatively, you may revise your pricing to ensure that you are competitive with other sellers in the same categories.
  

#### What happens after you revise your pricing and/or case studies?
We will use your updated information to make a final determination on whether your business offers value for money. This is a comprehensive assessment. It takes into account cost, represented by your maximum daily rate, and value, which is represented by your technical and commercial capabilities. VFM exists so that you can continue as an approved seller in your nominated categories on the Marketplace.
