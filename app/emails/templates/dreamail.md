Dear {{supplier_name}},

We recently conducted a [value for money (VFM)](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000054595-Seller-pricing) assessment of all sellers on the Marketplace. If you’re receiving this email, you’ve been assessed as not offering VFM.
  

To show that you do offer VFM, you now have the option of either revising your **pricing and/or strengthening your case study** in your chosen service category.
  

As offering VFM is a requirement of all sellers on the Marketplace Panel, we want to give you the opportunity to make these adjustments, so that you can remain competitive as an active seller with us.


**Please note:** After 1 January 2019, if you have not been assessed as offering VFM - you will no longer able to apply for opportunities in your chosen category.
  

## Value for money
When VFM is assessed, we consider both your pricing and your technical capabilities, as demonstrated in your relevant case studies. Together these are used to help us determine if you offer VFM. You may also refer to our support article on [assessing a seller’s value for money](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000427915-Assessing-a-seller-s-value-for-money).
  

If your case study is insufficient, we’ll ask that your case study material be strengthened. Stronger case studies help to demonstrate your capabilities, which may also provide justification for your higher pricing. You will also have the option of revising your pricing if you are assessed as not offering VFM.


## What happens after I revise my pricing and/or case studies?


We will use your updated information to make a final determination on whether your business offers VFM. This is a comprehensive assessment. It takes into account **cost**, represented by your **maximum daily rate**, and **value**, which is represented by your **technical** and **commercial capabilities**.


## What do I need to do?


To know if either your pricing and/or case study material needs attention, please see the details below regarding **your current VFM status** as a seller on the Marketplace.
