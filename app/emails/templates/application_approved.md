Congratulations,

{{business_name}} has been added to the Digital Marketplace. This means buyers from local, state and federal government can contact you and learn more about your business.

You’re also on our mailing list for new opportunities published by government buyers.

If you see something you like, make sure you express your interest in the opportunity early — **at least 3 days before the opportunity closes**.

This help give us time to complete an assessment if the opportunity relates to an area of expertise you’ve not yet been assessed for. This is all described in full in our seller guide.

**Where to next?**
